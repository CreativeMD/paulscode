# Paulscode SoundSystem

This is a checkin of code from [http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0](http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0).

Originally authored by @paulscode. The [license](./soundsystem/SoundSystem%20License.txt) allows us to do this.

We are doing this to allow fixing of outstanding bugs within the library and updating for use with Java 9 and beyond.

Builds will be available at files.minecraftforge.net.
